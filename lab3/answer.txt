The problem with this method is that, when we call 
isSameNumber, we are using == to check. The == is used to 
check if objects are the same, whereas .equals() is used to 
check if two values are the same. At 128, there is an error
because new objects have to be created for both, a and b, 
therefore, when we check if they are equal using ==, then it
checks if they are the same object, which they are not, as 
opposed to checking if they have the same value using .equals().
If we used a.equals(b), then the method would work correctly.
